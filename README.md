# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Using-ML
## Introduction 
Healthcare costs have been increasing steadily over the years and this has made it difficult for individuals to afford quality health insurance. The use of machine learning algorithms can help mitigate this problem by providing accurate predictions and allowing insurance providers to offer more personalized and affordable plans.\
In this project, we train the data from a .csv file, pre-process it, split it into a Training and Testing Data Set, and train using Regression Analysis. Various factors have been considered so that the algorithm is close to the real world models used.
